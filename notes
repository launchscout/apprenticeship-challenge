babeljs.io = a compiler
traceur = also a compiler (compiling JS)

ES6
destructing = a simplified way to call data

template strings = allows you to make a sentence out of variables using literal
sentences like such: `hi my name is #{name} and I like to #{thing}`

var not needed most of time. use let when coding ES6

const is similar to let in that it's block scope. const cannot be overwritten.

Use const to everything, you shouldn't need to change but if you do use let

arrow functions are basically functions with the word 'function' removed and replaced
with a hashrocket(=>). Allows for cleaner code.

When everything is on one line, you can drop the curly braces
This is known as implicit returns. Arrow functions also help to introduce scope (by eliminating bind)

like so:

var module = {
  age: 30,
  foo: function() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(this.age);
    }, 100);
  }
};
module.foo();

'=>' points to module, it points to the context that you are in.

module.exports.foo = function()

async functions return a promise and subs yield with await

====
[LIST] Starting a webpack development server:
1. npm install -s webpack-dev-server
2. npm install -g webpack-dev-server
3. webpack-dev-server        //webpack: bundle is now VALID.
4. type: webpack-dev-server --inline --hot (refreshes browser auto upon save)

State allows for you to inject variables into your dom that can update fast
so do props
